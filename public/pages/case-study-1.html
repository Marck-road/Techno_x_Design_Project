            Queueing has always been an integral part of society to keep everyone in the society more organized in handling their transactions. However, it is common to see long queue lines, especially in businesses, payment establishments, and hospitals. People would sometimes have to wait long hours on the site for their turn. Time is a precious resource that no one wants to waste. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-indent">
            This case study tackles how businesses and establishments can upgrade and innovate their queueing systems and transactions and give the general public a much more efficient and hassle-free queueing experience.

          Queuebytes aims to change how queueing works in the Philippines by providing a virtual queueing system that eliminates the long wait in physical lines. Queuebytes seeks to revolutionize the queueing experience by having both the users and businesses benefit from the system.

        <p class="text-indent">
          Traditional queueing methods lead to longer wait times, frustration, and wasted time for the customer and the business. Which could then lead to customer dissatisfaction, feeling of inconvenience and a loss of productivity for the customer and business side of things. This queueing system is outdated and inefficient. Queuebytes was initiated to address these drawbacks and create a more modern and user-friendly queueing solution.

                If the queue is too long and have wasted so much of their time already, most of them deal with it by leaving the area.

              <li>
                The queuing system currently uses physical papers and manually calling for the next customers.

              <li>
                For the staff's side they would prefer an automated queuing system where they don’t have to manually call the customers and provide physical paper.

              <li>

                  The admin wants to view the list of user accounts in a particular company. He clicks the row of the company in the dashboard and is redirected to the Company Details screen which contains a display of company details and the table of the list of users in that particular company. It contains the column names “ID”, “Username”, “Name”, and “Role”.

                  Admin wants to check any new companies or establishments who applied to use the system and goes to the request screen. He sees a table that contains all companies that have applied to use the system along with their ID, company name, email, contact number, the service they availed, and the status of their application if they are pending or paid. After confirming the company’s payment, the admin creates the domain for the company that applied. Once finished, the administrator will click the Paid status button to open the Enter Domain Link modal and inputs the designated domain link for the company. This sends an email to the company that their application is successful and sends them the link to their website with the working system.

            Time is of the essence, value your time properly and don’t waste it. Queuebytes can help modernize the traditional queueing in the Philippines. This could help not only the customers but also the business value their time and improve production.

            I have learned and experienced many things during the course of this project. From picking a topic to start to developing the high-fidelity prototype, I, together with my team, gained much insight during the design process, especially on how to properly plan and design the final system. Queuebytes all started from the spark of an idea on how queueing could be made much more efficient in our everyday lives, then incorporating an existing queueing system that we have, and then further developing and innovating the idea to become what it is today. We faced countless hurdles along the way in designing this project such as knowing our limitations, finding out ways to empathize with the possible users, and discovering any loopholes the system would have. Despite the challenges, the team persevered and would always find a way to resolve any problems and further improve our system.

          <i><h4>Masayon</h4></i>
          <p class="text-indent pb-3">
            I had fun with the discussions with my group mates. They help fill in the limitations of my ideas. We even usually argue over our points. But we do not take our disputes personally because we know that we only defend our ideas to make our points across for us to create a better solution. Hence, it is always necessary to brainstorm as a group because it will make the design process easier with more ideas.

          <p class="text-indent pb-3">
            During the design process, I have realized that there’s a lot of processes to go through before being able to actually design the system. As a group, we had some disagreements in the process but we were able to figure it out and make an agreement. Having a proper plan and design is vital to have a smooth sailing process.

        <p class="text-indent">
          Designing Queuebytes has allowed the team to develop new innovative ways to improve industries and infrastructures, enhance people's lives, and enrich society for a better future. Following the correct design procedures is necessary to build a proper system that would fit the user's needs and eliminate errors and unnecessary system features. It is important to brainstorm and act as a group to view the system's design from multiple perspectives, further refining our approach to creating a better queueing system for society.
