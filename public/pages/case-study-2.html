        <h1>1. Introduction:</h1>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          It is important to provide quality education to students and make it an inclusive and equitable educational environment. Schools need to implement a proper working system that is understandable to all to ensure a hassle-free experience for students and staff.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          As we progress through the digital age, digital solutions have started to be incorporated into educational systems to facilitate effective learning, teaching, enrolling, and student monitoring. However, there are still some schools relying on traditional systems such as using pen and paper and a spreadsheet to manage student data. Although this approach still technically works, it is still time-consuming and flawed and will also be frustrating to the staff handling it. 
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Eduops aims to solve the issue of schools struggling to operate due to outdated systems. This would allow the administrators and teachers of this school to manage their students’ data in a much more efficient and user-friendly manner. Not only that, the life quality of students would significantly improve with a more easier way to manage their payments, schedules, and tracking of their classes.  
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This case study will tackle how Sprach Institut can upgrade its business model and school system by creating an information management system to blend technology with quality education. This would significantly improve the quality of the staff and administrators of the institute in managing their systems as well as creating a better educational environment for the students and future enrollees.

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The purpose of this case study is to develop and implement an information management system called Eduops designed to streamline operations and improve the system at Sprach Institut. 
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Sprach Institut was facing challenges with their current system such as manual data management, enrollment processes, payments and class schedule which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With the help of Eduops, Sprach Institut will be able to automate task and streamline data management, freeing up staff time for other initiatives. It’s a user-friendly platform that will improve communication and increase the satisfaction for staff and students.

        <h1>3. Problem Statement:</h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdated or traditional educational system is a common problem that can negatively affect the efficiency and overall quality of education. This study aims to solve the following problems of an outdated system which include:
        <ul style="color: white;" class="mt-3">
          <li>Traditional or manual data entry - manually recording data is time consuming which decreases efficiency and productivity
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Prone to human error</b> - manually recording data is prone to errors which can impact the accuracy of the data being recorded
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Poor User Experience</b> - inefficient steps for the staffs and students lead to frustration
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Limited Accessibility</b> - outdated systems lack features	that could cater to the needs of the organization and students which can improve efficiency

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After interviewing the user, we were able to gather various information about the users. We were able to know their background, goals, pain points, etc. With this information we created user personas on MIRO board.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The common challenge that users face with the outdated system is that they have to manually enter data which is prone to errors and affects the accuracy of the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The current management system works by utilizing excel and pen and paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            The features that would help improve the system is an automated data management system where they wouldn't need to manually keep track of the records.

After placing our ideas, we then voted on which SDG to focus on which is Quality Education. This map helped us organize our ideas and make it one.

            After creating the lo-fi prototype, our team proceeded in designing the hi-fi version of it. Here, colors, pictures, a working navigation for all the users, and a most accurate final design in terms of details and functionality. This would serve as the actual blueprint for the system and what it would feel like when it would be used by the users.

              Designing this project has been really enjoyable and insightful. I was able to gain more experience in handling the needs and requirements of the clients and working hand-in-hand with them. The design process of the project allowed us to focus more on being user-centric and think of the possible designs that would benefit them the most. Anytime a problem would pop up, we as a team would resolve it together and ensure that everyone was on the same page. As we traversed through the entire design process, we would make sure that there would be no loose ends in our design and I am confident that our design thinking have significantly improved throughout the course of this project.

              It was a challenge for me to design our system for this SDG because this is where I truly learned the meaning and importance of the words "Design your system according to your user's wants and needs." Usually, the systems I designed and developed align with the user's preferences. Hence, it is a new experience for me wherein the user has different wants and needs, and what I want to design differs from theirs. So, in the end, it just boils down to the thought that I am only the developer. I have to comply with their requirements because they are the client, and they are the ones who will ultimately use the system.

              For this activity, I have learnt how important it is to consider the wants of the client despite not really agreeing with it, especially with the design and the colors. As a team, we were able to discuss ways on how we could combine their ideas with ours. Overall, it was a very insightful activity.

          In conclusion, the case study allowed the team to explore the design process and properly design the system to achieve its primary goal of improving and giving quality education to the beneficiaries. Through multiple design thinking principles, the team was able to uncover new ideas and solve problems that would arise throughout the various stages of designing the system. Hence, it is always important to be flexible and open-minded so that everyone can consider each other's ideas. After designing Eduops, the team is hopeful that it would successfully improve the client's processes of their institution by providing them convenient access to information and efficient support in teaching and learning practices through the designed system.
